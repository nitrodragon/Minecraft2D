# LWJGL 2D Minecraft/Terraria Clone
A LWJGL clone of Terraria—ish.
Despite the fact I hate Minecraft and all of its forms, I felt pretty proud of this project. 
## Controls
 - The 0–9 keys are for selecting blocks.
 - The C key clears the board.
 - The S key saves your map to an XML file.
 - The L key loads it back.
 - The mouse controls your position. Click to place a block.
 - The arrow keys and space can also be used.

### Hey, nitrodragon, Don't you have this in your [lwjgl_collection](http://github.com/nitrodragon/lwjgl_collection) repo?
Why yes, yes I do. This version, however, is far more complicated, elaborate, and commented, so I posted it separate as well.
